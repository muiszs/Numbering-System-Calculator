## Numbering-System-Calculator
The Numbering System Calculator is a text-based tool designed to help users convert numbers between different numeral systems. It features a simple menu-driven interface that is easy to navigate in a command-line or console environment. The calculator offers five main options: converting from decimal, binary, octal, or hexadecimal, as well as an option to quit the program. Each conversion option allows the user to input a number in the selected base and converts it into the other relevant numbering systems. The layout uses ASCII characters to create a clean and organized appearance, making it user-friendly for those working with various number systems in programming, mathematics, or digital electronics.
